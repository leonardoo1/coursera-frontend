                    Step 1.
                    Whisk lemon juice, oil, vinegar, onion flakes, garlic, lemon zest, Greek seasoning, poultry seasoning, oregano, pepper, and thyme together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. <br>
                    Step 2.
                    Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. <br>
                    Step 3.
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br>
                    Step 4.
                    Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess; thread onto skewers. Discard the remaining marinade. Place the skewers on a baking sheet. <br>
                    Step 5.
                    Roast in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. <br>

           Pork Medallions with Salsa  
         </h2>
         <p>
            1.
            In a shallow bowl, mix the jerk seasoning with the oil. Add the pork, spoon over the marinade and coat both sides. Cover and set aside for 5 minutes or longer for fuller flavour, if time allows.
            <br>
            2.
            To make the salsa, mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl, and season to taste.
            <br>
            3.
            Heat a large non-stick frying or griddle pan for a couple of minutes until hot. Add the medallions to the pan and cook for 10 minutes, turning once or until the juices run clear.
            <br>
            4.
            Steam or boil the sugar snap peas in a pan of water on the hob for a few minutes. Microwave the rice pouches according to pack instructions and stir in the kidney beans.
            <br>
            5.
            Arrange the rice mix and sugar snap peas onto 4 serving plates. Once the medallions are cooked, cut into slices and arrange on top of the rice. Spoon some salsa over each medallion and serve.
